## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to use a design system to make my stylings consistent and easier to implement

- Making my site more accessible to those with disabilities through the use of ARIA attributes

### Continued development

What I want to continue focusing on in future projects:

- Using custom properties and utility classes to organize my CSS
- Incorporating ARIA attributes and semantic HTML to improve page navigation
- Making CSS stylings more responsive using CSS functions (clamp(), min(), var() etc.)

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://web.dev/backdrop-filter/) - This resource helped me understand the backdrop-filter property and how to implement it. This was used to create the primary navigation for the website.
